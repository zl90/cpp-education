Group 1 (warmup):

Basic questions to get a feel of DP.

    https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/ in linear time

    https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/ (maybe)

Group 2 (linear sequence, linear time, constant transition):

Dp solution requires us to solve the sub problem on every prefix of the array. A prefix of the array is a subarray from 0 to i for some i.

Group 6 (linear sequence transition like N2 Longest Increasing Subsequence)

Dp problem is solved on every prefix of the array. Transition is from every index j < i.
