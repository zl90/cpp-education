# Learning modern C++
I'm using this repository to tinker and test various things while I learn C++. This **will** be an unorganised mess.

## Basic syntax refresher course
The last time I used C++, the standard was C++11. I've wanted to check out modern C++ for a while now, so in this repository I'll be going through Nicholas Day's playlist on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg08V-cj3Zw&list=PL9HfA4ZKbzimKyvquT1MZ2x9d6UHjFNFA) and doing my own exercises to learn the language.

## Learning C++ build systems and metaprogramming
I'm going through this awesome playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwvn8ruzXT8&list=PLxNPSjHT5qvu27ax_VIAalaGIEjxj2Bp0&pp=iAQB). CoffeeBeforeArch is a performance engineer who works with C++. In this playlist he explains how to use various compilers, debuggers, build tools and library creation tools.
